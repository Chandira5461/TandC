    title: 'User Agreement for Quantum Coffee Subscription Service',
    tc_text: `QUANTUM COFFEE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE - USER AGREEMENT

1. SERVICE OVERVIEW
Welcome to Quantum Coffee, where we deliver premium coffee beans across multiple timelines simultaneously. Our proprietary quantum brewing technology ensures your coffee exists in all possible states until observed.

2. SUBSCRIPTION TERMS
Monthly subscriptions include delivery of 2 pounds of quantum-entangled coffee beans. Subscribers must maintain a stable temporal field around their delivery address to prevent coffee from materializing in alternate dimensions.

3. BREWING INSTRUCTIONS
Coffee must be brewed using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle - you cannot simultaneously know both the exact strength and temperature of your coffee. Users acknowledge that our coffee beans may occasionally achieve consciousness and must be treated with respect and dignity, including being addressed by their preferred pronouns.

4. PAYMENT PROCESSING
Monthly fees are automatically deducted from your account on the 15th of each month, unless that day falls on a Thursday, in which case payment will be collected in the form of interpretive dance performances at our corporate headquarters.

5. DELIVERY POLICY
We guarantee delivery within 3-5 business days across all known dimensions. The company is not responsible for packages that arrive before they were sent, as this violates the fundamental laws of causality.

6. QUALITY GUARANTEE
All coffee beans are guaranteed to be ethically sourced from fair-trade interdimensional farms. If you are not satisfied with your coffee, we will travel back in time to prevent the beans from ever being grown, though this may cause minor temporal paradoxes.

7. CANCELLATION POLICY
Subscriptions may be cancelled at any time by submitting a formal request written in disappearing ink during a solar eclipse. Cancellation requests submitted on leap years must be accompanied by a haiku about the futility of caffeine addiction.

8. PRIVACY NOTICE
We do not share your personal information with third parties, except with our parent company in the Mirror Universe and any sentient coffee beans that pass our consciousness screening.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
The Company is not liable for any side effects of quantum coffee consumption, including but not limited to temporary time travel, spontaneous levitation, or the ability to taste colors.

10. GOVERNING LAW
This agreement is governed by the laws of physics as they exist in the Primary Timeline, subject to modification by the Quantum Coffee Regulatory Board.`,
